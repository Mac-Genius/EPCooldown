# EPCooldown
This plugin allows a user to set a cooldown time for using enderpearls. It will also force a user to look at the air to use, instead of looking directly at a block. You can also turn of endermite spawning in the plugin config file. Now you can also have custom messages! There is also a fancy scoreboard option to display the remaining cooldown of a player.
